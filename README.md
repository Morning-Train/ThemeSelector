# ThemeSelector
###### Google Chrome Extension
A theme selector for Facebook's Messenger (messenger.com) with multiple awesome looking themes!
Messengerâ€™s default colors are very bright - especially in the night. Therefore, most of our themes have dark colors to help you and your eyes. The dark colors can help with eyestrain and headaches caused by the light of the monitor.
